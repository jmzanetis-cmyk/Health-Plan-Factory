## 1. Build & EAS Configuration

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `eas.json` production profile: `autoIncrement: true` | **agent-verified ✓** | Build number increments automatically on each production build |
| `eas.json` production: `ios.simulator: false` | **agent-verified ✓** | Correct — App Store builds never target simulator |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` set to `https://api.healthplanfactory.com` in production profile | **agent-verified ✓** | Set in `eas.json` → `build.production.env` |
| `eas.json` CLI version `>= 10.0.0` required | **agent-verified ✓** | Documented in `eas.json` → `cli.version` |
| `eas.json` submit: `appleId` set to `developer@healthplanfactory.com` | **agent-verified ✓** | Email present — verify it matches the Apple ID account owner |
| `eas.json` submit: `ascAppId` — **PLACEHOLDER** | **requires human action ☐** | Replace `REPLACE_WITH_APP_STORE_CONNECT_APP_ID` with the numeric App ID from App Store Connect → App Information |
| `eas.json` submit: `appleTeamId` — **PLACEHOLDER** | **requires human action ☐** | Replace `REPLACE_WITH_APPLE_TEAM_ID` with your 10-character Apple Developer Team ID (found at developer.apple.com → Membership) |
| App slug `health-plan-mobile` and scheme `healthplanfactory` set in `app.config.js` | **agent-verified ✓** | Consistent with EAS project config |
| New Architecture (`newArchEnabled: true`) enabled | **agent-verified ✓** | Required for React Native 0.81+ and Expo SDK 54 |
| React compiler (`reactCompiler: true`) enabled | **agent-verified ✓** | Enabled in `app.config.js` experiments |

### Pre-build actions required

- **☐ Set EAS Secrets** before running `eas build --platform ios --profile production`:
  ```bash
  eas secret:create --scope project --name EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN --value "<your-sentry-dsn>"
  eas secret:create --scope project --name SENTRY_ORG --value "<your-sentry-org-slug>"
  eas secret:create --scope project --name SENTRY_PROJECT --value "<your-sentry-project-slug>"
  ```
  Sentry defaults (`healthplanfactory` / `health-plan-mobile`) are in `app.config.js` as fallbacks — source map uploads will fail without real values, but crash capture still works. See `SENTRY_SETUP.md` for setup instructions.

- **☐ Confirm RevenueCat API keys**: Three separate env vars are read by `lib/revenuecat.tsx`:
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_TEST_API_KEY` — sandbox/dev key (already set)
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_IOS_API_KEY` — production iOS key (set this in EAS Secrets)
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_ANDROID_API_KEY` — production Android key (set this in EAS Secrets)
  The app automatically uses the test key if the production keys are `REPLACE_WITH_IOS_KEY` placeholders.

- **☐ Run the production build**:
  ```bash
  eas build --platform ios --profile production
  ```

## 7. TypeScript Audit Results

**Run:** `pnpm typecheck` in `artifacts/health-plan-mobile/`
**Result:** **0 errors** (after fixes applied 2026-04-03)

### Errors Fixed

| Error | File | Fix Applied |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `NodeJS.Timeout` not assignable to `Timeout` | `app/(tabs)/coach.tsx:124` | Changed ref type to `ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>` |
| `Property 'nonce' does not exist on type 'AuthRequest'` | `lib/auth.tsx` | Added local `AuthRequestWithNonce` type extension; cast `requestRaw` to typed variable — no @ts-ignore needed |
| `Property 'queryKey' is missing` (UseQuery options) | `accountability.tsx`, `discover.tsx`, `index.tsx`, `journal.tsx`, `plan.tsx` | Added `partialQuery()` helper in `lib/api-client-react/src/index.ts` — callers pass `enabled`/`staleTime` without providing `queryKey`; hook uses its own real cache key |
| `Property 'createdAt' does not exist on type 'AuthUser'` | `accountability.tsx`, `index.tsx` | Added `createdAt?: string \| null` to `AuthUser` in both `lib/api-zod` and `lib/api-client-react` generated schemas — field is actually returned by the API |

### Native Module Errors — Left with `// @ts-ignore` (by design)

| Error | File | Reason |
|-------|------|--------|
| `Property 'Permissions' does not exist` | `lib/healthSync.ts:62` | `react-native-health` types don't export Permissions at module level; exists at runtime |
| Callback signature mismatches (`err: string` vs `Error | null`) | `lib/healthSync.ts:78,143,153,169,181` | `react-native-health` types use `string` for callbacks; `Error | null` is more correct |
| `BucketUnit` type narrower than `"DAY"` | `lib/healthSync.ts:219` | `react-native-google-fit` BucketUnit enum narrower than `"DAY" as const` |
| `getSleepSamples` expects callback, not Promise | `lib/healthSync.ts:226` | Runtime API supports Promise pattern; types show callback-only |
| `getDailyActivitySamples` not in types | `lib/healthSync.ts:234` | Correct runtime method name; types incorrectly show `getActivitySamples` |
